Introduction
============
This Chrome extension solves the Nonogram puzzle at https://ko.puzzle-nonograms.com
 
But this explanation is too dry.
 
As much as you perceive it, it is the limit of the world you live in.

Let me explain this extension more specifically in order to change your cognitive horizons, that is, your world wider and richer.
 
Sitting comfortably in a rocking chair and watching your dog run around on the wide lawn calms and warms your mind.
 
Of course, running on the lawn in sweat under the scorching sun on your own can also be a pleasurable experience, but most of the time, it's your dog who runs around the grass and you're the one who watches it. You are satisfied with this relationship and your dog is also satisfied.

This extension aims to provide a similar experience in the relationship between you and your computer. Just as you watch a puppy play on the grass, you can sit on your back in a comfortable chair as the computer unpacks the nonogram. Of course, you can also lie in bed and watch.

As soon as you click the Solve button, your computer will solve the puzzle at a dazzling speed.

The computer also releases a 30x30 nonogram in the blink of an eye.

Some may be upset that computers solve puzzles much faster than humans, but think again. No one is offended just because a puppy runs faster than a human.

No more wrapping your hair and not being in pain. Yield to your computer Your computer is born to calculate. Like watching and healing a puppy running fast on the grass and having fun, watch the computer finish the calculations in an instant.

In all of this process, all you need to gain calmness, joy, and a healing heart is the sensitivity to make your computer look like your pet.

Unleash your sensitivity from now on!
