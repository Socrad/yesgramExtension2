Introduction of the work
========================
This Chrome extension solves the Nonogram puzzle at https://ko.puzzle-nonograms.com

The entire process is not automatic, it only marks the tiles that should not be painted.
 
But this explanation is too dry.
 
As much as you perceive it, it is the limit of the world you live in.

Let me explain this extension more specifically in order to change your cognitive horizons, that is, your world wider and richer.
 
Sitting comfortably in a rocking chair and watching your dog run around on the wide lawn calms and warms your mind.
 
Of course, running on the lawn in sweat under the scorching sun on your own can also be a pleasurable experience, but most of the time, it's your dog who runs around the grass and you're the one who watches it. You are satisfied with this relationship and your dog is also satisfied.

This extension aims to provide a similar experience in the relationship between you and your computer. Just as you watch a puppy play on the grass, you can sit on your back in a comfortable chair as the computer unpacks the nonogram. Of course, you can also lie in bed and watch.

As soon as you click the Solve button, your computer will solve the puzzle at a dazzling speed.

The computer also releases a 25x25 nonogram in the blink of an eye.

Some may be upset that computers solve puzzles much faster than humans, but think again. No one is offended just because a puppy runs faster than a human.

No more wrapping your hair and not being in pain. Yield to your computer Your computer is born to calculate. Like watching and healing a puppy running fast on the grass and having fun, watch the computer finish the calculations in an instant.
 
In addition, your computer is loyal to you. The computer does the hard-won calculations you do in a flash, without blocking, but there's no interest in the glory of victory. The computer will yield victory to you. All you have to do is paint a tile that your computer hasn't blocked, and the glory of victory will be yours.

In all of this process, all you need to gain calmness, joy, and a healing heart is the sensitivity to make your computer look like your pet.

Unleash your sensitivity from now on!


How to install
==============
This program is a Chrome extension that is installed in the Chrome browser.


How to use
==========
When you press the Yesgram extension icon on another page, the “Go to the Nonogram site” button pops up. Pressing the button will take you to the Nonogram site.

When you press the Yesgram extension icon while the new Nonogram puzzle is displayed on the Nonogram site, the “Unpack Nonogram” button pops up. When you press the button, the computer releases the nonogram and marks the board with an X.

You can color it by clicking the mouse on the blank that is not marked with an X.

Additional) I tested it a while ago, and I don't think I can solve the monthly special Nonogram on time yet. This is the logic until the weekly special no-nogram.
